## Hi, I'm Elijah ðŸ‘‹
I started programming in 2015 as a JavaScript intern at a local startup. A year later, I received the Dean's Grant to work on a geospatial social networking application. My degree and initial career were in motion graphics, but I pivoted to software development in 2021 with a Harvard certificate course in web development. Since then, I have worked as a full-stack JavaScript/Python Engineer, for a shipping company and two startups in health-adjacent industries. I am currently wrapping up a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) where I am exploring my next steps as a programmer

- ðŸŒ± Currently learning: Physical computing and multiplayer game networking
- ðŸ”¨ Currently working on a [multiplayer ecological simulation game](https://elijer.github.io/garden/Projects/Eco-Mog) and an [input glove](https://elijer.github.io/garden/Projects/Gauntlet)
- ðŸ’» Let's talk about: technology in the education system, WebGL, Haskell, anything geospatial, and human-computer interaction
