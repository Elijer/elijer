## Hey! I'm Elijah 👋
I started programming in 2015 as a humble JavaScript intern at a local startup. A year later, I received the Dean's Grant to work on a geospatial social networking application, making many mistakes and falling for the excitement of large software projects. My degree and initial career were in motion graphics, but I pivoted to software development in 2021 with a Harvard certificate course in web development. Since then, I have worked as a full-stack JavaScript/Python Engineer, for a shipping company and two startups in health-adjacent industries. SInce expanding my relationship with programming during an amazing summer at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), I've been building fullstack web applications for seed-stage startups.
