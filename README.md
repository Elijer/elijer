## Hi, I'm Elijah ðŸ‘‹

I graduated from the VCU, the #1 public art program in the US, in 2016. The artist programmers I met there and the tinkering pathos of my classes set me on an unexpected course into software development. In 2015, I won a Dean's Grant to work on a geospatial social networking application, and worked as a JavaScript intern for a foster-youth-serving startup called ThinkOfUs. I followed my degree into a job as a motion graphics artist, but when programming in my free time wasn't enough, I quit my job to take a Harvard certificate course in web development in 2021. Since then, I have spent the past three years as a fullstack JavaScript/Python engineer for a shipping company and two startups in health-adjacent industries. I am currently wrapping up a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) where I am exploring my next steps as a programmer, both professionally, and as an artist.
