## Hi, I'm Elijah ðŸ‘‹

I graduated from the VCU, the #1 public art program in the US. The artist programmers I met there and the tinkering pathos of my classes set me on a course to eventually pivot from a career in video and motion graphics over to fullstack software development! Since finishing a Harvared certificate course in web development in 2021, I have worked for three years as a fullstack Javascript/Python engineer for a shipping company and two startups in health-adjacent industries. I am currently wrapping up a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) where I am exploring ways to grow as programmer, both professionally and as an artist. See what I am working on now [on the projects page of my blog](https://elijer.github.io/garden/Recurse/Projects)!
